1) Run the project in Google Colab.
2) Import weather.csv file in Colab by uploading the file. Please note that this file will be present in Colab till runtime.
So, if you are running the project again after refresh, then again you have to upload file weather.csv to Colab.
3) Project starts running from first cell which will install the required dependencies.
4) Cell 1-15 are used for all three models, so these cells are run only once for data preprocessing and cleaning.
5) Now, first we have implemented Decision Tree - Supervised learning.
6) Please run the below cells under the heading Decision Tree Classification model
7) Few cells will provide you the statistics with no hyper parameters included
8) Further, we have included hyper parameters.
9) Confusion matrix and t-SNE are displayed sequentially for Decision Tree.
10) Moving to Semi Supervised learning. Before running the cells below the heading Semi-supervised Learning with Decision Trees. Please run the cell above Semi supervised learning to create train and test datasets.
11) Further, confusion matrix and t-SNE will be displayed.
12) Now, to run neural networks with RNN, everything under this heading will correpsond to RNN model implementation.
13) Last but not the least, you can verify confusion matrix and t-SNE for RNN.
14) Happy Testing!!
